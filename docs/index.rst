TronWeb - TRON JavaScript API
=================================

TronWeb is a library that allows you to interact with `Tron Network <tron.network>`_

TronWeb aims to deliver a unified, seamless development experience influenced by Ethereum's `Web3 <https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/>`_ implementation. We have taken the core ideas and expanded upon it to unlock the functionality of TRON's unique feature set along with offering new tools for integrating DApps in the browser, Node.js and IoT devices.
